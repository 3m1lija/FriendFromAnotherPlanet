Girl: Here you go! You're lucky that these didn't get damaged at all.
Robot: Thank you again. I'm glad that I've run into you.
Girl: No problem! You're good to go back now. Where will you travel though?
Robot: I'm travelling back home. I was meaning to ask you...
Girl: What?
Robot: Do you want to travel with me, perhaps? It was fun exploring this place with you. It's a really beautiful home you've got.
Girl: I'd really love to, but... what if someone needs help too when I'm away?? There's no one in this place, but just me. I'd hate if someone ends up the same way as you did, but there will be no one to care for them... Maybe, someday we'll meet again. Then I will travel with you!
Girl: Have a good travel!
Robot: Thanks! Bye!
Girl: Bye!
